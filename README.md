## Example SQL Queries

```sql
-- Count of knee injuries by position
SELECT count(InjuryRecordID) AS NumofKneeInjuries, Position
FROM players
INNER JOIN Attributes ON players.playerID = Attributes.PlayerID
INNER JOIN [Injury Records] ON players.playerID = [Injury Records].PlayerID
INNER JOIN [Injury Type] ON [Injury Records].InjuryRecordID = [Injury Type].InjuryRecordID
WHERE InjuryName LIKE '%knee%'
GROUP BY Position
ORDER BY NumofKneeInjuries DESC;
```

```sql
-- Severe injuries with recovery steps
SELECT RecoveryPlanID, InjuryName, InjuryDetails, InjurySeverity, GameType, NextSteps
FROM [Injury Records]
INNER JOIN [Injury Type] ON [Injury Records].InjuryRecordID = [Injury Type].InjuryRecordID
INNER JOIN [Recovery Plan] ON [Injury Type].InjuryTypeID = [Recovery Plan].InjuryTypeID
WHERE InjurySeverity = 'Severe';
```
